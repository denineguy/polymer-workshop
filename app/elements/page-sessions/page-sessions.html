      <p>
        Are you a front-end/JavaScript developer that is looking to develop
        evergreen applications (apps that will be fresh this year, next year and
        even the year after that)?  Do you want to use the coolest and latest
        technologies to develop apps with the most progressive techniques and
        tools? This session will introduce futuristic developers to Polymer.js: a
        library created by Google which makes building custom elements easy.

      <p>
        An introduction to AngularJS that will get you up to speed with building
        your own applications. We will build a small application using AngularJS
        and several key modules. An emphasis will be placed on testing using
        Jasmine. You will be required to download and set up the project shell
        before the workshop. Details will be provided.

      <p>
        Moving fast and being agile is a hot topic today. Don't be left in the
        dust: Learn to harness the power of the cloud and strap a rocket-sled to
        your build, test, and deployment processes. Attendees will watch a project
        go from zero to cloud tested and deployed using popular services and
        technologies in under an hour. It really is *that* easy -- and it will
        all happen live. Helpful metrics, prestigious badges, and a few laughs at
        those inevitable (and hopefully infrequent) build failure notifications
        are all part of the fun, helping these cloud powered continuous
        integration methodologies stick with attendees after returning home.

      <h3 id="tommyeverett">Tommy Everett - JS Code Evaluation: Soup to Nuts</h3>
      <p>
        Many JS programmers have little or poor understanding of what actually
        happens to the JS code they write. This talk will cover the process of
        taking JavaScript code, parsing, compiling, and executing it in a general
        fashion - though some attention to the details of the SpiderMonkey, V8,
        and Higgs JavaScript engines will be paid.
      </p>

      <p>
        Starting with a quick overview of the ES standard/process, we'll move on
        to parsing, and then lexical analysis - with a brief discussion of the
        quirks/features of JS in this area such as ambiguity between object
        literals/blocks, semicolons, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next is a general overview of the compiler/interpreter architecture of
        some of the main JS engines, and how they differ from each other - some
        of the benefits/drawbacks, etc. Whether they use an interpreter, what
        different types of compilers they use, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        If time allows, we may get into some of the features of JS that compiler
        writers have difficulty optimizing as well as some other related concepts
        like asm.js.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ideally audience members will have heard of phrases like "parsing" and
        "compiler" but not be entirely sure how they actually work and how they
        relate to JS - and walk away with a better overall understanding of the
        concepts and be able to describe in a general (possibly specific) fashion
        what happens to their code once they give it to the JS engine.

        Douglas Grogg, Justin Thomas and Alexandra Hoefinger - Ditch Your
        Framework, or How we learned to stop worrying and love ES6
      </h3>
      <p>
        At Urban Outfitters we pride ourselves on working with, and investing in
        modern web development tools. On a recent project, after much debate, we
        decided to forgo using any framework, because of 3 new features that ES6
        gave us: Promises, Modules, and proper Classes. ES6 gives developers the
        foundation to build complex apps in native JS. No more black boxes. Write
        code that is powerful and 100% yours.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this session we would discuss, why the dependency load of a framework
        might no longer be necessary. We will go through how to implement ES6
        features in your app design patterns, with a primary focus on Promises,
        Classes, and Modules, but also touch on fat arrows, block scoping, string
        interpolation, and destructuring. We'll also explain how to use ES6 now
        (its only natively supported in Firefox currently, Edge and Chrome in the
        fall) via BabelJS and Browserify, and how to include it in your gulp
        workflow. Finally we will go over the drawbacks and additional
        complexities that are involved when you no longer have a framework to fill
        in the gaps.

      <h3 id="williamjeffries">William Jeffries - Cognitive Bias and Code</h3>
      <p>
        In this talk, we'll discuss several cognitive biases, how they're hurting
        your codebase, and what to do about them.
      </p>

      <p>
        We'll begin with an explanation of the familiarity, availability, and
        anchoring biases, with examples of each. Then we'll discuss their effects
        on design choices in code, with examples. Lastly we'll talk about how your
        team can deal with them more effectively.
      </p>

      <p>
        You'll walk away with a better understanding of cognitive biases and how
        to protect your codebase from them.

        Cordova is a platform to create apps for Android, iPhone, and other mobile
        platforms using primarily HTML and JavaScript. Cordova plugins give these
        apps ability to interface to the native platform to interface with things
        like the camera, filesystem, or even your own native drivers to external
        devices.
