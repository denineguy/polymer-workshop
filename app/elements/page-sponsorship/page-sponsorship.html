      <h2>Sponsorship Prospectus</h2>

      <h3>What’s LibertyJS?</h3>

      <p>
        LibertyJS is the community-super-powered JavaScript conference in
        Philadelphia, organized by the same team of Philadelphia JavaScript
        Developers, the premier JavaScript user group with over 1000 members
        enthusiastic about JavaScript development.
      </p>

      <p>
        Founded in 2014, LibertyJS is the first JavaScript conference to be held
        in Philadelphia, and had over 100 attendees in its first year. We have
        exciting plans for 2015, and we’d love you to be a part of the event.
      </p>

      <p>
        LibertyJS 2015 is Saturday, June 20, 2015 at ImpactHub in Philadelphia.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Why Sponsor?
      </h3>

      <p>
        LibertyJS provides unprecedented access to overwhelmingly local JavaScript
        talent (although we confess to attracting some out-of-town attendees).
        We’re gathering smart, motivated, technical individuals for one great
        summer learning event, and by participating you’ll have the opportunity
        to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Recruit for JavaScript roles at your organization</li>
        <li>Raise your profile among this specialized set of developers</li>
        <li>Demonstrate your commitment to the JavaScript community</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to Sponsor?</h3>

      <p>
        Our levels of sponsorship are as follows. For higher levels,
        logos/mentions/job postings will be larger and more prominent in all materials.

      <h3>Additional sponsorship options:</h3>

      <p>
        These are great options if you’re seeking a unique way to showcase your
        presence to attendees.
      </p>

      <h4>Lunch Sponsor: $1500</h4>

      <p>
        Be promoted as lunch sponsor for event, extra signage indicating
        sponsorship during lunch, and your company may bring 3 company
        representatives to lunch to mingle with JavaScript developers.
      </p>

      <h4>Breakfast Sponsor: $600</h4>

      <p>
        The “early bird” advantage - sponsor breakfast, and you’ll be very
        visible, first thing in the morning at a central popular event location!
      </p>

      <h4>Coffee Sponsor: $500</h4>

      <p>
        No technical event should be decaffeinated. With this sponsorship, you’ll
        provide coffee/tea/drink options throughout the day to attendees. Includes
        “Coffee sponsored by” signage in what we all know to be a high
        foot-traffic area of events! This can be combined with a Bronze or Silver
        sponsorship.
      </p>


      <p>
        None of these options quite what you’re looking for? Custom sponsorship
        packages available
